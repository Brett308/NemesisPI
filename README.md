Note: This project is a work in progress.

picoThermal is a fork off of picoReflow by [apollo-ng]. It is intended to make it more 
versatile by adding several features:

* Ability to disable cooling, air, door sensor, etc.
* Handling of two separate heaters
* Automatic PID tuning
* Time and temperature units defined per profile
* Temperature PWM loop separated from control loop
