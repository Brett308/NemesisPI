NemesisPI is a fork of picoThermal which is a fork off of picoReflow by [apollo-ng]. It is intended to make it more 
versatile (suited for reflow oven or ceramic kiln) by adding several features:

* Ability to disable cooling, air, door sensor, etc.
* Handling of two separate heaters (NW)
* Automatic PID tuning
* Time and temperature units defined per profile
* Temperature PWM loop separated from control loop
* Option to wait for system to reach target temperature before going to next profile stage
* For ceramic kilns, dynamic calculation of end temperature based on heat rate (NW)
* Set costings to minutes and program default

This software is now in active use controlling my electric kiln and is working reliably. The added options make it suitable for a much wider range of thermal controllers than the original.
