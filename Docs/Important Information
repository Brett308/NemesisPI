Never Close Terminal with out stopping firings first while in manual mode and kiln is on as this will cause kiln will go full power always press STOP in controller program and timer will not count down

Always set this option in config.py once that temperature hits that temperature it stops program but not if you close terminal as explained above in manual mode
emergency_shutoff_temp = 1270

Keep your controller software updated ,come back from time to time to see the advancements we are making!!!
